# 2026 Gaming Challenge Tracker

**This project is entirely generated by an AI agent (GEMINI) via "vibe coding". All code, logic, icons, and imagery were conceived and implemented through AI-driven development.**

A highly immersive, responsive web-based application designed to track progress through a curated list of video games for the 2026 yearly challenge. This project transforms a simple checklist into a tactile "Digital Game Shelf" experience, complete with virtual hardware, evolving companions, and retro aesthetics.

## 🎮 Core Features

- **3D Box Flipper:** Every game is presented as a physical box art that flips in 3D to reveal detailed stats, Metacritic scores, and descriptions.
- **Universal Retro Console:** A virtual top-loading hardware interface. Clicking "Play" visually inserts a dynamic cartridge into the slot, switching the console from Standby (Red) to Active (Green). Ejected cartridges persist your last-played game art.
- **Permanent System Monitor:** A dedicated header marquee that scrolls real-time console metadata, featuring a reactive LED and infinite-loop ticker tape.
- **Tactile Review System:** "Seal the Record" by slamming theme-specific rubber stamps onto the box art, accompanied by a satisfying "thud" and theme-synced confetti.
- **Gamer Profile & RPG Stats:** 
    - **Alignment Chart:** A 2D coordinate grid tracking your gaming personality (Body vs. Mind, Action vs. Logic).
    - **Journey Map:** A chronological vertical trail visualizing your 2026 milestones.
    - **Achievements:** A dedicated vault for category completion trophies.
- **Dual Media Archives:**
    - **Poster Gallery:** A collection of high-fidelity custom posters for every completed game.
    - **Press Clippings:** Authentic 90s-style magazine advertisements generated procedurally.
- **LO-FI Radio & Visualizer:** 18 unique procedural stations (Quest Start, Cyber Pop, 8-bit Chill, etc.) with a beat-reactive oscilloscope visualizer integrated into the header.
- **Reactive Companion (buddy.exe):** An 8-bit desktop pet with 100+ lines of dialogue that evolves based on your progress.
- **Retro Boot Sequence:** A fake BIOS startup with technical diagnostic text and 8-bit sound effects, featuring a tactile "Power On" interaction.
- **Console Skins:** 11 unique visual identities including **Blueprint**, **Woodgrain**, **Papercraft**, **Candy**, **Arcade**, and **Obsidian**, selectable via a visual theme picker.
- **CRT Mode:** A toggleable visual filter adding scanlines, screen curvature, and chromatic aberration.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

- **Architecture:** Vanilla JavaScript SPA with a modular CSS structure.
- **Audio:** Custom procedural 8-bit sound engine using the Web Audio API.
- **Visuals:** Pure CSS shapes for hardware; Canvas API for real-time frequency analysis and particle physics.
- **Data:** Persistent state management using `localStorage` with Base64-encoded Full System Saves.

## 🚀 Building and Running

Since this is a static web project, no build or installation steps are required.

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. For the best experience, use a local server (e.g., `npx serve .` or VS Code Live Server).

# 2026 Gaming Challenge Tracker

**This project is entirely generated by an AI agent (GEMINI) via "vibe coding". All code, logic, icons, and imagery were conceived and implemented through AI-driven development.**

A highly immersive, responsive web-based application designed to track progress through a curated list of video games for the 2026 yearly challenge. This project transforms a simple checklist into a tactile "Digital Game Shelf" experience, complete with virtual hardware, evolving companions, and retro aesthetics.

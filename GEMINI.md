# 2026 Gaming Challenge Tracker

**This project is entirely generated by an AI agent (GEMINI) via "vibe coding". All code, logic, icons, and imagery were conceived and implemented through AI-driven development.**

A highly immersive, responsive web-based application designed to track progress through a curated list of video games for the 2026 yearly challenge. This project transforms a simple checklist into a tactile "Digital Game Shelf" experience, complete with virtual hardware, evolving companions, and retro aesthetics.

## 🎮 Core Features

- **3D Box Flipper:** Every game is presented as a physical box art that flips in 3D to reveal detailed stats, Metacritic scores, and descriptions.
- **Universal Retro Console:** A virtual top-loading hardware interface with Hardware Persistence—the ejected cartridge always displays the last-played game's label and title.
- **Interactive Instruction Manual:** A physical "Book Spine" sitting next to the console. Clicking it opens a 12-page, high-fidelity booklet containing system lore, pro tips, a full 48-game catalog, and system credits. The manual's material and ink live-update to match the active console skin.
- **Smart Jump Interaction:** Click the inserted game on the console to instantly locate and highlight its card on the shelf.
- **Permanent System Monitor:** A dedicated header marquee that scrolls real-time console metadata, featuring a reactive LED and infinite-loop ticker tape.
- **Tactile Review System:** "Seal the Record" by slamming theme-specific rubber stamps onto the box art, now with theme-optimized backgrounds for maximum legibility on all 11 skins.
- **Gamer Profile & RPG Stats:** 
    - **Alignment Chart:** A 2D coordinate grid tracking your gaming personality (Body vs. Mind, Action vs. Logic).
    - **Journey Map:** A chronological vertical trail visualizing your 2026 milestones.
    - **Achievements:** A dedicated vault for category completion trophies.
- **Dual Media Archives:**
    - **Poster Gallery:** A collection of high-fidelity custom posters for every completed game.
    - **Press Clippings:** Authentic 90s-style magazine advertisements generated procedurally for every finish.
- **LO-FI Radio & Visualizer:** 18 unique procedural stations with a beat-reactive oscilloscope visualizer integrated into the system monitor.
- **Reactive Companion (buddy.exe):** An 8-bit desktop pet with 100+ lines of dialogue that evolves based on your progress.
- **Console Skins:** 11 unique visual identities (Blueprint, Woodgrain, Papercraft, Candy, Arcade, Obsidian, etc.) selectable via a visual theme picker.
